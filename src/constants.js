    "Every year public funding for the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) has hovered around 40 percent of the City of Charlotte’s general fund budget. The most recent proposal for the FY2021 city budget starting July 2020, allocates $290.2 million to CMPD, an increase of over $4 million from FY2020. This budget is scheduled to come up for a vote by the City Council on Monday, June 8th.",
    "Between 2013 and 2019 CMPD has killed people at a higher rate than the nationwide average. Black people were killed by the police at 3.1x the rate of white people. CMPD has yet to enact even the most basic reforms to prevent police killings including bans on chokeholds or strangleholds, restricting shooting at moving vehicles, requirements to exhaust all other means before shooting, requiring other officers to intervene if they see an officer using excessive force, and extensive reporting requirements.",
    "We do not need more police. We need the City of Charlotte to invest in communities.",
    "Black communities and other communities of color in Charlotte have faced systemic racism for centuries. Systemic racism is systemic violence and the current coronavirus pandemic exemplifies that violence. Black people in Mecklenburg county make up 48 percent of positive COVID 19 cases and 50 percent of deaths despite making up only 33 percent of the population. Furthermore, before the pandemic, data showed that it is virtually impossible to escape poverty in this city. In an economic mobility analysis of the 50 largest cities in the country Charlotte ranked last.",
    "We do not need more police. We need the City of Charlotte to invest in communities.",
    "The budget battle is just one part of a larger fight - the fight for Black lives. The upheaval and revolution of this current moment is similarly part of this same movement. The police are overmilitarized and exist to uphold white supremacy and systems of oppression. The Charlotte City Council and Mayor Vi Lyles MUST cut the CMPD budget, especially as its cops continue to meet protests against their extreme state-sanctioned violence with more violence.",

      "Hello,",
      "My name is (Your name) and I'm a resident of (Your city or city council district)",
      "We are in the midst of a health pandemic with severe economic consequences. Unemployment surged to 12.8 percent in April, an increase of roughly 9 percent, higher than the peak of the 2008 recession over a decade ago. Black people are dying at a disproportionately higher rate due to the coronavirus pandemic making up 48 percent of cases and over 50 percent of deaths. Furthermore, the City Council has yet to take any meaningful action to curb poverty in the city. It is absolutely unreasonable for people to get ahead. In this context, the City Manager is proposing a $4 million increase to CMPD, making up over 40 percent of the city’s proposed budget for FY 2021.",
      "We are also in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence — embodied by the CMPD — which murders Black people. We will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.”",
      "We need to defund the CMPD. We need to #DefundThePolice. We need a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of the people of Charlotte during this trying and uncertain time; and we need a budget that supports communities and supports their wellbeing, not which empowers the force(s) that tear them apart.",
      "I am urging you to completely revise the proposed budget for FY2021 and fund #CareNotCops. Invest in communities not police.",

      "Hi,",
      "My name is [Your name]. I'm a resident of [Your city or city council district]. I’m writing to demand for a reduction of the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department’s $290.2 million budget allocation, with no additional funding of over $4 million allocated to CMPD in the 2021 budget. I am also writing to demand that the city of Charlotte abolishes CMPD’s usage of chemical weapons and rubber bullets.",
      "In the context of nationwide protests against racist police brutality, CMPD has relentlessly stalked, manipulated, cornered, kettled, teargassed, pepper balled, and attacked the community it claims to serve. They have assaulted peaceful protesters, medics, children, and reporters with reckless abandon. On June 2, officers trapped a crowd of peaceful protesters in a parking garage with tear gas, pepper balls, and flash-bangs. A viral video of this incident has sparked outrage in North Carolina and beyond. As the Charlotte Observer wrote in its coverage of the attack, one protester stated that it felt as though their face “was melting off.” These chemical weapons, which are supposedly “non-lethal,” often result in violent injuries. Other cities have seen victims lose their eyes to rubber bullets and suffer horrific respiratory attacks from being pepper sprayed or teargassed. The usage of airborne chemical agents is particularly cruel and dangerous when considering the fact that coronavirus already weakens the respiratory and immune systems.",
      "Attempts to reform the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department have been woefully inadequate in reducing racial disparities in policing. Between 2013 and 2019 CMPD has killed Black people at 3.1 times the rate of white people -- higher than the already shameful national average. In spite of these troubling statistics and the national outcry against the murders of Keith Lamont Scott, Danquirs Franklin, and many others, CMPD continues to drag its feet on even the most basic reforms: bans on chokeholds or strangleholds, banning shooting at moving vehicles, requirements to exhaust all other means before shooting, requiring other officers to intervene if they see an officer using excessive force, and extensive reporting requirements. Its community review board serves only an advisory role, and as a result, a whole lot of community input is summarily ignored.",
      "The truth of the matter is that pouring 40% of our city’s budget into a bloated, militant, and punitive police force will not stop crime in our city. It will only serve to encourage broken-windows policing, criminalize Black Charlotteans and waste tax dollars. If we want to stop crime, we have to fund the measures that will prevent it: education, arts, parks, social services, services for homeless and impoverished people, and healthcare.",
      "Teargassing protesters and trying to spin it a week before a budget vote is not how you build trust in a city already marred by racist police violence. If anything, this reflects an outrageous disregard for our community’s safety and well-being, and the outright danger CMPD presents to the most vulnerable Charlotteans. CMPD’s platitudes, kneeling, and “community outreach” don’t fool us. It is past time to retire the use of chemical weapons and pull back funding of CMPD.",
      "Cities across America are reevaluating their racist policing systems, and we hope that Charlotte can be at the forefront of this movement. We will not be considered a leader for the New South if we do not interrogate racism in every way that it exists in Charlotte.",
      "Please do your part and implement these measures.",
