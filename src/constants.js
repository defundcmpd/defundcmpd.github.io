    "Every year public funding for the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) has hovered around 40 percent of the City of Charlotte’s general fund budget. The most recent proposal for the FY2021 city budget starting July 2020, allocates $290.2 million to CMPD, an increase of over $4 million from FY2020. This budget is scheduled to come up for a vote by the City Council on Monday, June 8th.",
    "Between 2013 and 2019 CMPD has killed people at a higher rate than the nationwide average. Black people were killed by the police at 3.1x the rate of white people. CMPD has yet to enact even the most basic reforms to prevent police killings including bans on chokeholds or strangleholds, restricting shooting at moving vehicles, requirements to exhaust all other means before shooting, requiring other officers to intervene if they see an officer using excessive force, and extensive reporting requirements.",
    "We do not need more police. We need the City of Charlotte to invest in communities.",
    "Black communities and other communities of color in Charlotte have faced systemic racism for centuries. Systemic racism is systemic violence and the current coronavirus pandemic exemplifies that violence. Black people in Mecklenburg county make up 48 percent of positive COVID 19 cases and 50 percent of deaths despite making up only 33 percent of the population. Furthermore, before the pandemic, data showed that it is virtually impossible to escape poverty in this city. In an economic mobility analysis of the 50 largest cities in the country Charlotte ranked last.",
    "We do not need more police. We need the City of Charlotte to invest in communities.",
    "The budget battle is just one part of a larger fight - the fight for Black lives. The upheaval and revolution of this current moment is similarly part of this same movement. The police are overmilitarized and exist to uphold white supremacy and systems of oppression. The Charlotte City Council and Mayor Vi Lyles MUST cut the CMPD budget, especially as its cops continue to meet protests against their extreme state-sanctioned violence with more violence.",

Unemployment surged to 12.8 percent in April, an increase of roughly 9 percent, higher than the peak of the 2008 recession over a decade ago. Black people are dying at a disproportionately higher rate due to the coronavirus pandemic making up 48 percent of cases and over 50 percent of deaths. Furthermore, the City Council has yet to take any meaningful action to curb poverty in the city. It is absolutely unreasonable for people to get ahead. In this context, the City Manager is proposing a $4 million increase to CMPD, making up over 40 percent of the city’s proposed budget for FY 2021.",

We need a budget that adequately and effectively meets the needs of the people of Charlotte during this trying and uncertain time; and we need a budget that supports communities and supports their wellbeing, not which empowers the force(s) that tear them apart.",
